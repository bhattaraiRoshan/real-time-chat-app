# Project Description 

This project is a real-time chat application built using a modern full-stack approach, leveraging React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, Socket.IO for real-time communication, and MongoDB as the database for storing chat messages and user data.

## Key Features
Real-Time Messaging: Instant, bidirectional communication between users through WebSockets, powered by Socket.IO. <br>
User Authentication: Secure login and signup functionality, with sessions handled via JWT tokens or cookie-based authentication.<br>
Private Chats: Users can chat one-on-one.<br>
Persistent Chat History: All chat messages are stored in MongoDB, allowing users to retrieve message history even after they log out and back in.<br>
Online Status Indication: Displays the online/offline status of users in real-time.<br>
Responsive UI: Fully responsive design using React and Bootstrap, ensuring the application works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technoogies Used 
React: For building a dynamic and interactive user interface.<br>
Node.js: Backend server for handling API requests, authentication, and integrating with Socket.IO for real-time communication.<br>
Socket.IO: Enables real-time, bidirectional event-based communication between the client and server.<br>
MongoDB: NoSQL database used to store chat messages, user data, and chat history.<br>
Express.js: A minimalist web framework for building the backend API and handling HTTP requests.<br>
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For user authentication and authorization in a stateless manner.<br>
Bootstrap: For styling and making the UI responsive across different devices.<br>
